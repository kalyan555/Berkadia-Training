# Difference between the loops
##for
this loops through a block of code a number of times
## for Each
The forEach() method calls a provided function once for each element in an array, in order
## for in
This loops through the properties of an object
## for of
This is a new loop in ES6 that replaces both for-in and forEach() and supports the new iteration protocol.
