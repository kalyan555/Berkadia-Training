# NPM
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

# 20 Most Important Packages
## Express
All common programming languages share similar structures in the way things are built, one of the fastest ways to get a programming language to serve your needs, is through a framework. Express is the leading Node.js framework for quickly creating and publishing applications, and APIs. The frameworks minimal structure allows any Node.js developer to quickly launch a functional application with the use of Express Generator. The rest is up to you, as Express gives you a solid outline to build your apps on top of. Combine it with any of the other packages we will discuss, and you will quickly realize just how amazing this framework truly is.

## Async.js
Asynchronous JavaScript has rebuilt the way JavaScript content interacts with your web pages, allowing you to increase performance by getting rid of render-blocking JavaScript. Render-blocking basically means that any JavaScript content that resides in the “above the fold” parts of a page will not be loaded, until JavaScript itself has been finished loading in the page. This can have certain effects on the performance of your website, but with the helps of libraries such as Async.js — you can open the door to load JavaScript content alongside everything else, sometimes even faster. The library is meant to be used with Node.js, originally, but these days it will work with browsers too, so you can inject it in any project, whether it uses Node.js or not. There are more than twenty functions that this library gives you control over.

## Request – Simplified HTTP Client
Apps constantly have to deal with external HTTP calls, whether to fetch data, or to load data directly from an external source. Having a reliable way to do HTTP calls is essential, which is why Request has grown to be the most reliable HTTP Client library of them all. With Request, making HTTP calls becomes an easy, secure, and reliable way of accessing external content on the web, in any form imaginable. It works well with authentication methods too.

## Browserify
Working with JavaScript libraries can prove to be a difficult process, you constantly have to go back and forth between templates to analyze which libraries and widgets are using the specific scripts, and eventually these scripts begin to add up as you start to lose track of what is working for what. As JavaScript progresses, the notion that we are just building websites, well.. is gone. In many ways, websites built with JS these days act more like apps — versatile projects that depend on heavy libraries that work independently. There are many uses for Browserify, but the most important one is that Browserify allows us to create the kind of client-side codebase that’s organized, structured, and easy to navigate. Anyone can use Browserify to create solid components that quickly allocate dependencies according to their use at any particular situation. Node.js projects tend to stack up on packages, libraries and scripts, and Browserify helps to structure everything neatly together.

## Socket.IO
Socket lets you build truly real-time communication apps that would require real-time streams of content, whether directly from the data that you are working with, or through an API that comes from an external source. Some example apps that we have seen is a Twitter bot for collecting latest tweets, a Facebook bot for watching news, and other interesting combinations of APIs that work with data in real-time. Just imagine what such communication methods could do for your analytics, truly real-time analytics are still being actively developed even by large companies such as Google Analytics, but with Socket — you just happen to get early access to all that.

## Mocha
Even more asynchronous action going on here in this Node.js package roundup, this time we have Mocha — a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Testing is so important to understand how well the application is performing, where we can locate any particular leaks, and also to know how we can improve these bugs, problems, and irritations that we experience, testing lets developers to understand better how their code performs, and in turn learn more skills as they continue down their chosen path.

## Bower
In (very) old days, websites didn’t consist of much more than HTML and CSS, and in some cases JavaScript. Nowadays, websites almost can’t exist without the use of external libraries, tools, frameworks, and other JS related utilities that make a modern website. Having to keep track of all these utilities can turn into a strenuous task, there is so much to control and keep in check.. it only makes sense that package managers such as Bower exist. Bower manages your components for you, if they are of JS, CSS, or HTML nature. (Fonts, and visual content works too!) Bower carefully allocates all the packages that you are using, and then helps you to keep the updated, and regularly checked against any potential risks. A simple Bower file can help you maintain an application the size of Fortune 500 companies.

## Cheerio
Want to use jQuery within the server-side of things? Now you can with Cheerio. Cheerio is a fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server.

##Nodemailer
Sending email is one of the most sensitive things that you will do with your apps. Email is a big deal, and having a secure way of doing email transactions is essential to your reputation. That’s why they built Nodemailer, a secure framework for doing email management within your Node.js applications. Documentation provides extensive amounts of samples on how to get Nodemailer to work with SMTP.

## React
React — the most talked about UI framework of modern JavaScript times. Combining React with Node.js makes for an amazingly fast web application experience. Developed by Facebook, React lets you build fast interfaces that scale and focus only on the important parts of your UI. What makes React so appealing to developers too, is the fact that it can work on top of any technology stack that you are already using, without actually interfering with external technologies.

## Node MySQL
MySQL, the world’s most recognized database server. Where would the world be, if it wasn’t for MySQL and all that it has brought about. True, in modern development, many choose to go for more simple database servers, like MongoDB, but to deny popularity of MySQL; it’s just pure ignorance. The Node MySQL library is a native implementation of the MySQL Protocol for the Node.js JS Client. GitHubbers are starring this one faster than we can blink, get it on the party wagon!

## LESS
LESS is a recognized and reputable CSS pre-processor that significantly improves your CSS workflow, and overall front-end development experience. Pre-processors transform CSS to act more as a programming language, rather than just a scripting environment. Many reasons to choose LESS, but most important one: it’s free, it’s reliable, and hundreds of thousands of developers use it daily.

## MongoDB Node.JS Driver
As we mentioned, MySQL is very popular amongst database managers, but so is MongoDB. This library will provide a necessary driver for those who wish to implement a full version of MongoDB within their Node.js projects. This will give you the necessary room to use MongoDB to its full potential within your Node projects.

## JSHint
Weeding through code to find and fix bugs is never fun, in fact..it can have a huge imprint on your productivity, and the way you code. This is why linting tools came about, linting tools help you to analyse common bugs and errors in your code, without your focused attention. Instead, a linter just analyses the code itself, and gives you potential errors and fixes that could drastically improve the code you are writing. Any code base eventually becomes huge at some point, and simple mistakes—that would not show themselves when written—can become show stoppers and waste hours of debugging. And this is when static code analysis tools come into play and help developers to spot such problems. JSHint scans a program written in JavaScript and reports about commonly made mistakes and potential bugs. The potential problem could be a syntax error, a bug due to implicit type conversion, a leaking variable or something else.

## Morgan
With millions of downloads each month, Morgan is one of the top priority libraries for Node devs. Morgan is a HTTP request logger, storing HTTP requests and giving you concise insight into how your app is being used, and where there could be potential errors or other issues that you haven’t yet explored. Easily the most reliable HTTP logger known to the Node.js community.

## WebPack
WebPack lets you use dozens of modules in your project, without having to worry about their locations and overall performance. WebPack, as the name suggest, packs all your modules in separate JS, CSS, and HTML files and gives you back an easy workspace for the browser. You can split, bundle and allocate code as you like thanks to WebPack.

## Angular
What’s the best framework for rapid app building? Many will argue, but for many, Angular will sit at the top of the decision. Angular.js allows its users to build fast client-side web apps that would resemble a modern browser. Angular has a certain vibe to it, it makes the process of building rich-and-modern web applications so easy, yet so flexible, that it leaves you wondering… what were you doing without this framework all this time.

## Restify
APIs remain as one of the most important parts of any Node.js application, it’s what makes the real-time actually become real. If you are looking to build a RESTful API, then Restify library will give you the quirks and tools required to perform the task. In more ways than one; Restify is the library you will want to use when building REST services for the web. It’s simply that good.

## Marked
Markdown is a minified, more elegant, version of HTML. Markdown lets you convert text to HTML by using specific markdown syntaxes and tags. While HTML focuses on making everything appealing to the web, Markdown on the other hand wants to put the focus on text, specifically on the way text is presented, and how to best help online editors to output beautiful text, with less trouble and learning of HTML. The Marked Node.js library will implement Markdown in any project, app or website that you’re working on.

## GraphicsMagick
