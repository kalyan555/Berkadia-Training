# Promise libraries

## Bluebird:
Loaded with features and should be one of the fastest around and with special empathizes on error handling via good stack traces. Features can be toggled via custom builds.

##  Catiline:
Mostly designed for handling of web workers but contains a promise implementation. Uses lie underneath.

## ES6 Promise polyfill:
Borrows code from RSVP, but implemented according to the ECMAScript 6 specification.
