# Naming Conventions for REST API
Some of the best naming conventions to be adopted while designing the REST API are
* Should be Simple
* Should be Intuitive
* Should always be consistent
* Should avoid camel caps as urls are not case sensitive. The norm is to use lower case letters.
* Should use dashes instead of underscores
* While naming an API consider it to be a folder. Follow the naming pattern similar to folder structure
* Use Hierarchy
* Most important point to keep in mind while designing an API is maintaining the version number in the API
